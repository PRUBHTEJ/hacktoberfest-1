I am leading the efforts of Hacktoberfest 2019 at parity. Between helping out in community outreach and organising events, I am coding on substrate - primarily in the runtime and developer facing side, general infrastructure and architecture and plumbing of consensus.

Learn more about me on [my personal website and blog](https://gnunicorn.org).
